# OpenLR - An effort to create a standardized Line Rider library! In Haxe!

Line Rider is a toy/game originally released in 2006 that has been played and improved upon since then. HXLR refers to the 'library' part of OpenLR, and is a Haxe port of the core code used to create an deterministic engine that runs in parity with other Line Rider engines. OpenLR refers to any Haxe based Line Rider program that uses HXLR and is in this repository. Currently, the main framework is Heaps, but is subject to change. Older versions used OpenFL as a framework.

A Playable example can be found here: https://kevansevans.github.io/openlr/
## Goals
* Provide the backbone to an engine that can run in parity with other existing Line Rider engines
* Offer the necessary tools and classes to aid developers in creating their own engine
* Ensure that the code provided is flexible enough to offer the ability for more customized/non-standard behaviors
* Have fun!
## How to use
1) Clone Repository or download library folder
2) Open directory and run command ``haxelib dev hxlr ./path/to/hxlr/src``
3) Include library in Haxe project.
4) Have fun!
